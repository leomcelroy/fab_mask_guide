const mainContent = `During the COVID-19 pandemic, Fab Labs across the world have become centers for prototyping and producing PPE supplies for local hospitals, social service organizations and front-line workers. Because of their physical and social assets, Fab Labs are uniquely positioned to respond to sudden need for PPE (protective personal equipment) in the communities where they are located. Fab Labs typically contain a range of digital fabrication tools (such as laser cutters, 3D printers, and CNC routers) needed to quickly create multiple versions of a product, in both the prototyping and small-scale manufacturing stages. Fab Labs also tend to attract and sustain engaged communities of individuals who are solutions-minded. 
<br/><br/>
Producing PPE will be an important part of the mission and business of many Fab Labs over the next several months or years. Many people feel compelled to do something to address the stark inequalities highlighted by the pandemic. Low income communities in particular are impacted by job insecurity and are more likely to contract the disease due to lower ability to practice social distancing. Local PPE production can address both sides of this issue by ensuring local availability of PPE and by providing opportunities for some to supplement their income.

This toolkit provides comprehensive guidance on how to set up a system to produce face masks in a Fab Lab. The mask design was chosen for its utility as a basic face mask and as a higher performing protective filter, as well as its ability to be made in community Fab Labs. This toolkit includes a bill of materials, instructions on each part of the production process, guidance on safety procedures and legal disclaimers, as well as sample documents that can be printed out and used directly.`
